When talking about Kubernetes Security, the very first step is to secure the VM's or Physical servers that is running the kubernetes.

Some of the key measures we can take is:
1. SSH based authentication only to nodes
2. No Open Ports
3. Put them in private subnets and no internet connection
4. Sharing access only to limited people
etc...

But in CKA, we need to look at kubernetes security in detail like how we can secure kubernetes components like api server, etcd, controller, scheduler, kubelet etc

Kube api server is center of all operations and our kubectl commands interacts with kube api server and this is the first line of defence.

1. Authentication- who can access
a. usernames and passwords in plain files
b. username and tokens
c. certificates
d. LDAP
e. Service accounts

2. Authorization - what they can do once you get the access
a. RBAC- Where users are put in groups with permissions
b. ABAC- Attribute based access controls
c. Node authorization
d. webhooks


All communication between components happens via Certificates. Ex api to etcd, api to controller

Communication between pods security - Network Policies
