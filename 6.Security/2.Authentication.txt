Like we create Service account, we cannot do kubectl create user balaji in kubernetes since Kubernetes dont handle user creation natively.

Then how do you do? The very basic way to do is basic auth setup where you can write password,username,userid,groupid in a simple plain .csv file or text file

Ex: balaji@123,balajibrb,u001,balajigrp

So now you have created a auth file called login-details.csv and you need to tell kubeapi to use this file.

You need to edit /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kubeapi-server.yaml and edit the command section to add this line --basic-auth-file=login-details.csv. So once you add, since kubeapi
is a static, any changes in file will recreate the pod.

Or you can add that file as a volume mount for your kube api pod in its yaml
