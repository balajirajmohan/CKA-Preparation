What is the purpose of scheduler? scheduler schedules pods into nodes.
- How the scheduler works?
  scheduler flow consists of two steps.
     -->> filtering
     -->> scoring
      filtering- first it identifies the correct node that can match the pods requirements such as cpu memory and restrcitons
                 such as taints and tolerations. Once it identifies the correct node, step 2 will happen.
      scoring: This is the actual implementation. Once the node the identified, it will schedules the pod. But in case of multiple
                eligible nodes, it will do a score based ranking and picks the best out of it.


kube scheduler is the default scheduler mechanism in kubernetes. if you dont have any scheduler, your pods will be in pending state.
If you dont have any scheduler, you still can assign your pods into your nodes. In your pod yaml, you have to write nodeName parameter.
You can specify node name only during the start time or before kubectl apply -f

Can you assing a pod to a node when it is in pending state? Yes, you can create an object called binding with node name as spec.
Once you create the binding, you can call Pods api and post the binding you created.

YAML file for binding:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Binding
metadata:
   name: balaji ----->>> Random name for the binding
target:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: node
  name: workernode-1 --->> name of the node that you want to schedule your pod

Once you create the binding, you can post the binding to pods api
