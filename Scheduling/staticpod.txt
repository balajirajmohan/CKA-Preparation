What is a static pod?

we all know that kubelet is reponsible for creating pod. but kubelet needs api server to provide instruction and manifest
scheduler to instruct kubelet to run pods
etcd to store the results.

But what if you dont have api server, scheduler, etcd and no master node.
you will be left only with worker nodes. worker nodes only have kubelet, kube proxy and docker installed.

But still, kubelet is capable of running a pod, restart the pod if crashes. Since there is no kube api server to provide yaml,
    you have to login to worker node and put the pod yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifests folder.


As soon as you put the file, kubelet will scan the file and provision the pod.any changes in that file will lead to change in resources.

Note: it works only at pod level and cannot create deployment, replicaset etc. Such pod is called as STATIC POD.
