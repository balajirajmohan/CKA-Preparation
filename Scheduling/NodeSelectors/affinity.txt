NodeSelectors: this uses nodes labels and we can add node labels in our pod configuration to schedule a pod into a particular node


You can see the operator In being used in the example. The new node affinity syntax supports the following operators: In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Gt, Lt. 
You can use NotIn and DoesNotExist to achieve node anti-affinity behavior, or use node taints to repel pods from specific nodes.
