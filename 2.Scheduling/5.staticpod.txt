What is a static pod?

we all know that kubelet is reponsible for creating pod. but kubelet needs api server to provide instruction and manifest
scheduler to instruct kubelet to run pods
etcd to store the results.

But what if you dont have api server, scheduler, etcd and no master node.
you will be left only with worker nodes. worker nodes only have kubelet, kube proxy and docker installed.

But still, kubelet is capable of running a pod, restart the pod if crashes. Since there is no kube api server to provide yaml,
    you have to login to worker node and put the pod yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifests folder.


As soon as you put the file, kubelet will scan the file and provision the pod.any changes in that file will lead to change in resources.

Note: it works only at pod level and cannot create deployment, replicaset etc. Such pod is called as STATIC POD.

********** Important ******************

/etc/kubernetes/manifest - is this the only folder that we are supposed to use? well, not like that. its your choice.
                           But kubelet should know where to look for the manifest file and you need to instruct it.

How to tell kubelet that where to look for pod manifest in this case?

when you install kubelet as a service in a manual way, you need to give this parameter --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifest
when you install cluster using kubeadm- rather than having giving --pod-manifest-path, in kubelet service conig,
                                         it uses a parameter called --config=kubeconfig.yaml
                        Inside kubeconfig yaml, below data will be there
                          staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifest

Scenario 1: without master, only with the help of kubelet, balaji created a static pod. Later vaidhee scolds balaji to
            install master node and all its control plane components. When balaji do kubectl get po, he will still able to see
            the static pod created as a pod, but cannot do any changes (only read) since it is not created,instructed by kube-api

Scenario 2: From where kubelet receive instructions:
             1. Primarily using http call from kube-api server ( all resources can be created)
             2. In case kubeapi is not installed, kubelet looks for pod manifest in /etc/kubernetes/manifest folder in worker nodes
                and create only pods


How the pod will get name incase of static pods- even though the yaml have name of the pod, it will be appended by worker node name
                                                  example: balaji-pod-workernode1

all control plane will are deployed as static pods when you install kubernetes via kubeadm
