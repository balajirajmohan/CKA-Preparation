We know that kube scheduler is reponsible for choosing a right node for pod based on taints, node affinity.
If you choose to go for default shcheduler, it is called as kube-scheduler.

But if you are not happy with the default shcheduler, you can bring your own scheduler in addition to default one.
So you will be having two schedulers which is called as multiple shcheduler.

Ways to do it?
edit the default shcheduler yaml and recreate it to have your own custom scheduler.
Or dont delete the existing scheduler, with the custom yaml, you can have new one as secondary.

How to create a second custom scheduler:

if you had setup your kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, you would be having of kube scheduler yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifest/kube-scheduler.yaml
take a copy of it and create a new schduler by changing name, port, leader-elect as true
