If you take a pod into consideration, every pod needs 3 important resources as their requirements
  -- CPU
  -- MEMORY
  -- DISK

We know that pods can have a certain default resource requirements that it can take over the runtime. But where does it come from?
While creating a namespace, we need to create a mem-limit-range and cpu-limit-range yaml. it is different from quotas
If a Container is created in a namespace that has a default memory limit, and the Container does not specify its own memory limit, then the Container is assigned the default memory limit.
