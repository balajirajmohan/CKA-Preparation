Lets say if you want to upgrade your kubernetes cluster, first you have to take a backup of all resources, etcd.

How do you backup resources - if you provisioned all resources using yaml files, you can have them in your github

But, if you created some of the resources using imperative way, you have to do kubectl get all --all-namespaces-o yaml > all-resources.yaml

How to take backup if etcd?

etcd stores info about state of cluster and rathe than taking backup of resources, take a backup of etcd cluster itself.

etcd stores all data in /var/lib/etcd with config key --data-dir

How to take snapshots:
1. Take a snapshot of the db-->>  ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save balaji.db
2. To view the snapshot of db --->> ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status balaji.db
3. To restore the backup - stop the kubeapi first, service kube-apiserver stop
                           ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore balaji.db
                           systemctl daemon reload
                           service kube-apiserver start
