kube proxy is a more of a network component that sits in all worker nodes.
By default, all pods inside kubernetes cluster can talk to each other with the help of pod networking.
Pods can talk to each other using their IP and we know that pods are ephimeral in nature and their ip's are temporary
So we recommend to use service and if we create a service, pods can talk to service and service routes the traffic to backend pods
Does that mean service also belongs to pod network? --- > No, service is just an object and it is not part of any pod networks.

As soon as you create a service, it will get an IP. you can talk to a service using its name or IP and it will route the traffic to backend pods.
service uses iptables concept to route traffic to backend pods and kube proxy is the networking piece which is responsible for it.

How to install kube proxy?? 
kubeadm- it will automatically install kube proxy in kube-systems namespace
manual way- you have to install the binaries and configure it as a service on all worker nodes
