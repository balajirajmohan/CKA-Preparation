kubernetes controller is the brain behind kubernetes which ensures the desired state of the cluster.
There are different types of controllers available in kubernetes, out of which we will talk about below:

Node Controller:
This is the controllers which monitors worker nodes and its health.
Kubeapi server constantly talks to kubelet and get health status of nodes every 5s.
if something goes wrong, controller will be informed by kubeapi server and node controller will start its check. it will wait for 40 seconds
   by default to consider a node is unhealthy and will wait for 5 mins to come back. if not, it will evict the pods and place it into another
   health node

Replication Controller:
this is the one who monitors pods and works same way as node controllers

The collection of all controllers in kubernetes is called as kube contoller manager
