etcd is a key value store that can be used to store date in the form of key value pair.

How to install etcd?
Step1: Download the etcd binary from official github page
Step2: Untar and extract the binary so that it will result in a shell script file
Step3: Run the file ./etcd

Once you run the above command, etcd service will start and listens on port 2379
Like kubectl to talk to kubernetes api, there is a client called etcdctl to talk to etcd service

To write a key-value store in etcd- ./etcdctl set key1 value1
Example: ./etcdctl set name balaji

To get a value of a key from etcd -->> ./etcdctl get key1

Everything you get from kubectl get commands comes from etcd

There are 2 methods to deploy kubernetes cluster. kubeadm way and all from scratch manual way. So accoring to that way you setup, etcd setup
will also varies.

If you install kubernetes on your own or manual way - you need to download etcd from github and configure it as a service and add the
url advertiser url with your master node private ip

If you use kubeadm- etcd will be run as a pod in master node under the kube-system namespace

what is advertiser url - it is the url and the port where you actually represent etcd ( internalip:2379)

But in case of multiple master nodes, you have to spread etcd in multiple masters and you can configure below:
initial cluster option with all master node ip:2380


---------Optional---------------
(Optional) Additional information about ETCDCTL UtilityETCDCTL is the CLI tool used to interact with ETCD.ETCDCTL can interact with ETCD Server using 2 API versions – Version 2 and Version 3.  By default its set to use Version 2. Each version has different sets of commands.

For example ETCDCTL version 2 supports the following commands:

etcdctl backup
etcdctl cluster-health
etcdctl mk
etcdctl mkdir
etcdctl set

Whereas the commands are different in version 3

etcdctl snapshot save
etcdctl endpoint health
etcdctl get
etcdctl put

To set the right version of API set the environment variable ETCDCTL_API command

export ETCDCTL_API=3

When API version is not set, it is assumed to be set to version 2. And version 3 commands listed above don’t work. When API version is set to version 3, version 2 commands listed above don’t work.

Apart from that, you must also specify path to certificate files so that ETCDCTL can authenticate to the ETCD API Server. The certificate files are available in the etcd-master at the following path. We discuss more about certificates in the security section of this course. So don’t worry if this looks complex:

–cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
–cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
–key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key

So for the commands I showed in the previous video to work you must specify the ETCDCTL API version and path to certificate files. Below is the final form:

kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system — sh -c “ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get / –prefix –keys-only –limit=10 –cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt –cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt –key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key”
