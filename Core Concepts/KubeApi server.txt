Whenever you type kubectl get nodes, you are talking to kubeapi in the first place.
kubeapi authenticates your request and pass it etcd to get the details and post the details back to you
kubeapi is the only component that can talk to etcd.

How a pod creation works basically?
when you type kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
             |
             |
             |
   your request will first go to kubeapi. kubeapi will authenticate you based on same mechanism.
   Also, kubeapi will check for duplicates and checksum validation from etcd. if all goes good, scheduler will always look for kubeapi commands.
   so, scheduler posts a node placements request via kubelet into one available node and kubelet responds back to kubeapi as done.
   kubeapi updates the state changes in etcd and also posts the user back with a pod created message on the screen
