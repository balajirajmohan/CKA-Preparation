Kube scheduler is one of the key component to identify the right node for a pod based on below factos:
    1. labels and selectors
    2. Taints and Tolerations
    3. Node affinity
    4. Resources and requirments

Kube scheduler will not actually schedule the pods into nodes. Once the scheduler identifies the right node, it will notify
the concerned kubelet in the worker node and kubelet will take care of scheduling the nodes.


How to install kube scheduler?
if you are using kubeadm, scheduler will be deployed automatically on kube-systemt namespace.
if you are setting up kubernetes from scratch- you have to download from github and install in on all master node.
